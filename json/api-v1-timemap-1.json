We also got fur pelts and sewed them into hats which were big enough to cover our ears.  And mittens were sewn out of these pelts as well.  And to cover our feet (and legs) and keep warm we used whatever we could find. When you are out on patrol for two hours in this climate the cold becomes unbearable. And then you sit and drink tea.\n\nWealthy Chinese come here and play cards with our battalion commander all night.He wins a lot of money and they say: \"Captain shanza.\" To the Chinese an officer of any rank is a \"captain\" - he may be a general or a lieutenant - it is all the same.\n\nWe are learning to speak Chinese. We are getting used to them and to bargaining with them.  They bring us Chinese sugar which is either black or yellow. It \"only\" takes a half pound of sugar to sweeten a cup of tea and even then it is not very sweet.\n\nEggs are very cheap - 1 kopeck an egg.

We still had to march 790 viorst on foot. The first day we had to march 30 viorst. We left at 5 o'clock in the morning, yawning and barely able to stay on our feet.\n\nThe reason for our misery is the weight we have to carry - just like horses.    We have to carry our heavy shine (soldier's overcoat) covered with a fur pelt, a rucksack containing our underwear, water canteen, ammunition and all kinds of small items. It is a heavy burden and on top of all the other items already mentioned you have to carry your rifle. You drag everything with all your strength - you could say: with your life - and you curse the day you were born.\n\nAbout 5 o'clock in the afternoon we entered a Chinese chandza factory (or: gin mill). Here we will have to spend the night. We enter the building, we throw down our heavy packs which are pressing on us and are killing us. Suddenly things seemed a lot better. Now we begin to feel the pains. One soldier yells. \"My hand!\" Another can't stand up on his feet.\n\nAfter we rest up a bit we forget some of our troubles.  We walk outside to look around and to see where we are. We see chickens, ducks and geese running around.  When we go to buy this poultry the fun begins. For every one who pays cash nine simply steal.\n\nSome soldiers quickly build a fire and we start cooking. One soldier is eating. Another is cooking and another is getting himself thoroughly drunk so that he doesn't know what's going on around him and he falls asleep. We rested up and when we reminded ourselves that tomorrow we must continue the march - the thought made our hair stand on end.\n\nFirst we lay down on the bare ground to go to sleep, then we got some straw to put under ourselves and we slept through the night quite comfortably because we were dead tired.\n","description_media":"","description_notes":"*shinel=coat\n\n**790 viorst=520 miles\n\n*** 30 viorst=20 miles\n\nLocation extrapolated from text\n\n","description_census":"","description_sources":""},{"end":"","sort":0,"media":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B11CmKpqRcD9Zk9lQXZPelRNYXc/view?usp=sharing","place":"","start":"1900-12-19","title":"Seven days of bitter cold","location":"43.817071 125.323544","description":"<div><div data-reactroot=\"\"><!-- react-text: 2 --><!-- /react-text --><p><p>We are awakened at 5 o'clock in the morning, are served a meal and we continue on our way.

Perim was actually a small island at the southern entrance of the Red Sea and it was a British colony. Sadly, Perim was destined to be the final resting place for the poor officer.\n\nOn a small boat, accompanied by an honor guard of riflemen, the officer's body was taken to the Perim Island. There, as we were told later, the officer was given his final rites, according to full military honor with pomp and ceremony.\n\nNone of the members of my company knew the officer nor did any of us have any particular love for an officer yet we all felt sad. We felt sad because this officer had managed to survive the war and was on his way home, and here, suddenly, he is buried in a strange land, far away from his home and family. The only thing we had to be grateful for was that he was not thrown into the water - that would have been a cruel fate - to be eaten by fish in the ocean.\n\nOur boat did not linger much on Perim. There was the -usual loading of supplies, though with a twist this time.    Our boat got a thorough cleaning on the outside. Workers toiled for a whole day to scrub off the build-up of moss and other debris. Then it was washed and hosed down neatly. This task completed and also the loading of the goods our ship was ready to resume its voyage.\n\nSuddenly, the band (always present with us on board) erupted in a happy tune. This lifted our spirits right away. The music was always used as a morale builder. This time, it was especially appropriate, after the incident with the dead officer – our morale was quite low.\n\nAs the music was playing, we all watched the anchors being lifted and our boat slowly sailed into the open sea. This time, our destination-the city of Suez in the Red Sea.","description_media":"","description_notes":"","description_census":"","description_sources":""},{"end":"","sort":0,"media":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B11CmKpqRcD9MkZHdi0xTGs2V1k/view?usp=sharing","place":"","start":"1901-04-06","title":"\"...like a child's plaything.\"","location":"16.226630, 41.066895","description":"<div><div data-reactroot=\"\"><!-- react-text: 2 --><!-- /react-text --><p><p>Unfortunately,    the next day we are hit with a weird combination of strong wind and pouring rain.

Some said that we'd probably have to undergo a thorough medical examination. (Feodosiya was the military headquarters and assembly point  for all troops returning from the war.) But what happened next was not exactly what the rumors were all about. </p><p></p><p>When our orders finally came to leave the boat we were extremely happy and thankful to the good Lord that he was no longer having us sail in the \"seven seas\" and that we were alive and well. </p><p></p><p>First our belongings were put on wagons and we were taken of all places to the customs office for an inspection. Who would have expected that of all things, the first thing would be an examination of our belongings to see if we didn't bring in \"contraband\" from our foreign pursuits?</p><p></p><p>I personally had nothing of value or importance to declare nor did any of my fellow soldiers.    The whole thing was a real farce and we certainly weren't afraid of the consequences of the customs inspection. The inspection was finally over and we were taken to the bath- house. This was really a treat as we had not taken a real bath for ages. We were very happy with the turn of events after the customs inspection and all.</p><p></p><p>We felt like newborn babies, fresh and clean and really good about ourselves. We went back to the assembly point when the order was given and we all broke out in song as we were marching along. Our regimental orchestra went back into action and suddenly we felt like soldiers again, but of a happy sort. Not the kind of soldiers who go to war, but the kind that return from war, back to peace and life. At first we didn’t know where we were heading. We knew that Zhmerinka was our final destination, it was our home base, but how soon we'd be on our way there was still unknown to most of us soldiers.</p><p></p><p>At the assembly point, an orchestra was playing again and we were given food fit for a king. \"Fonie\" was generous and we were all fed as follows: white bread (it tasted like challa*) and a big portion of halva** which we hadn't seen in ages.  To finish it off. We also each received a glass of vodka - a royal treat.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the time came for us to leave Feodosiya, which after all we had suffered through, gave us such a nice welcome. We were put on wagons with our gear, which was quite a luxury, and off to the railway station to board the train back to Zhmerinka, at last.</p><p></p><p>In all the commotion, while boarding the train, we noticed something unusual. A young Chinese boy, dressed in Russian military garb was being closely watched by an officer. As we found out earlier, the officer brought the boy from Manchuria as a \"trophy\", a memento of his adventures in a foreign land. The Russian soldiers followed him with their eyes in disbelief. Some threw coins at him, perhaps to see if he would dance. The more daring ones just   plain poked   fun at him and asked him to reveal his braid, which was neatly covered beneath his cap.</p><p></p><p>After this bit of \"fun and games\", we were assigned our seats on the train.

Some said that we'd probably have to undergo a thorough medical examination. (Feodosiya was the military headquarters and assembly point  for all troops returning from the war.) But what happened next was not exactly what the rumors were all about. \n\nWhen our orders finally came to leave the boat we were extremely happy and thankful to the good Lord that he was no longer having us sail in the \"seven seas\" and that we were alive and well. \n\nFirst our belongings were put on wagons and we were taken of all places to the customs office for an inspection. Who would have expected that of all things, the first thing would be an examination of our belongings to see if we didn't bring in \"contraband\" from our foreign pursuits?\n\nI personally had nothing of value or importance to declare nor did any of my fellow soldiers.    The whole thing was a real farce and we certainly weren't afraid of the consequences of the customs inspection. The inspection was finally over and we were taken to the bath- house. This was really a treat as we had not taken a real bath for ages. We were very happy with the turn of events after the customs inspection and all.\n\nWe felt like newborn babies, fresh and clean and really good about ourselves. We went back to the assembly point when the order was given and we all broke out in song as we were marching along. Our regimental orchestra went back into action and suddenly we felt like soldiers again, but of a happy sort. Not the kind of soldiers who go to war, but the kind that return from war, back to peace and life. At first we didn’t know where we were heading. We knew that Zhmerinka was our final destination, it was our home base, but how soon we'd be on our way there was still unknown to most of us soldiers.\n\nAt the assembly point, an orchestra was playing again and we were given food fit for a king. \"Fonie\" was generous and we were all fed as follows: white bread (it tasted like challa*) and a big portion of halva** which we hadn't seen in ages.  To finish it off. We also each received a glass of vodka - a royal treat.\n\nFinally, the time came for us to leave Feodosiya, which after all we had suffered through, gave us such a nice welcome. We were put on wagons with our gear, which was quite a luxury, and off to the railway station to board the train back to Zhmerinka, at last.\n\nIn all the commotion, while boarding the train, we noticed something unusual. A young Chinese boy, dressed in Russian military garb was being closely watched by an officer. As we found out earlier, the officer brought the boy from Manchuria as a \"trophy\", a memento of his adventures in a foreign land. The Russian soldiers followed him with their eyes in disbelief. Some threw coins at him, perhaps to see if he would dance. The more daring ones just   plain poked   fun at him and asked him to reveal his braid, which was neatly covered beneath his cap.\n\nAfter this bit of \"fun and games\", we were assigned our seats on the train. The train was very crowded. And there were more of us than there were seats. We had to make the best of it in our assigned car.  Soon we began to sweat from the heat and crowded conditions. Our neat bath and fresh clothing were a thing of the past. A lengthy train trip was about to begin.\n\nWe left Feodosiya around 10:00 p.m. ","description_media":"","description_notes":"","description_census":"Total: 24,096 Russian Orthodox=14,213 Muslim=3,386, Jewish=4,342\nPage 219","description_sources":""},{"end":"","sort":0,"media":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B11CmKpqRcD9bHBYanZiRGZHWmc/view?usp=sharing","place":"Мелитополь","start":"1901-04-16","title":"Melitpol","location":"46.8550° N, 35.3587° E","description":"<div><div data-reactroot=\"\"><p><strong>Modern Name/Spelling:</strong><!-- react-text: 4 --> <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 5 -->Мелитополь<!-- /react-text --></p><p><p>The following day, April 16th we arrived at Melitopol.

Right away, we started to get ready. We took care of our personal hygiene, got washed, and combed our hair and also put on our new, clean uniforms. When we inspected each other, we laughed and joked about our appearance because we looked like \"toy soldiers\", dressed for a masquerade.    \n\nWe hadn't seen ourselves dressed in such ship-shape in a very long time. Soon, the \"great moment\" arrived, and we were all ready for inspection.
